--   📖 AI governance: medium/claude/subarticle_3_trust_layer.md#ai-governance
--   📖 Metadata context: medium/claude/subarticle_3_trust_layer.md#building-a-metadata-catalog

-- ============================================================================
-- PURPOSE:
-- Maps healthcare entities (providers, HCPCS codes, specialties, locations)
-- and their relationships for AI context and traversal.
-- Minimal but sufficient for semantic model understanding.
--
-- ============================================================================

-- Knowledge graph scaffolding for entities and relationships.
-- Keep this minimal and focused on providers and HCPCS codes.
