Suggestions for Improvement
1. Add Visual Architecture Diagrams
Your docs/ folder references diagrams but I didn't see rendered images. Adding a high-level architecture diagram to the README would increase engagement.
2. Include a "Before/After" Demo Video
A 90-second screen recording showing the VP asking natural language questions vs. writing SQL would be powerful for Medium.
3. Add Troubleshooting/FAQ Section
Include common errors users encounter when setting up Cortex Search services — this becomes highly searchable content.
4. Version the Semantic Model
Consider adding SEMANTIC_MODEL_v1.0.0.yaml, SEMANTIC_MODEL_v1.1.0.yaml to show evolution — this reinforces the Trust Layer concepts.
5. Medium-Specific Formatting

Add "📌 Key Takeaway" callout boxes every 3-4 sections
Include a "TL;DR" at the top of each article
Add "💡 Pro Tip" sidebars for advanced users
