Top 10 States by Total Spend:

State	Total Spend	Total Claims	Avg Payment
CA	$24.68M	358,778	$65.40
TX	$24.07M	325,869	$72.58
FL	$20.28M	295,657	$68.44
CO	$16.61M	204,237	$74.46
NY	$15.05M	222,997	$66.41
Why California leads:

Population size: CA is the most populous state (~39M), with the largest Medicare beneficiary population
Aging demographics: Large elderly population (65+) with higher chronic respiratory disease prevalence
Air quality concerns: While CA has made progress, certain regions (Central Valley, LA Basin) still face air quality challenges that can exacerbate COPD and respiratory conditions
High altitude areas: Not primary factor for CA (unlike CO at #4), but regional variations exist
Healthcare access: Extensive Medicare provider network and higher utilization rates
Interesting patterns:

CO ranks #4 despite smaller population - likely due to high altitude (respiratory stress) and outdoor lifestyle demographics
FL ranks #3 - reflects large retiree population with chronic conditions
NC and TN show highest avg payments ($81-79) - possibly reflecting rural access patterns
Pollution is A factor, but population size and age demographics are likely the primary drivers.



Factor -- if it gives 60-70% answer correct, still saves lots of time, can validate answers faster than writing and building analytics appraoch from the start
